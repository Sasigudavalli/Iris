# Iris
Data science using builtin dataset.
****In this Repositary dataset is given it is a builtin dataset we can import directly through seaborn it consists many datasets Iris is one of it.****

**Iris Dataset Classification with Linear and Logistic Regression**

**Overview**
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the Iris dataset using Linear and Logistic Regression models. The analysis demonstrates how to achieve accurate predictions and visualize the results using various methods such as box plots, heatmaps, displots, and pair plots.


**Project Details**
Dataset
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics. It contains measurements of iris flowers from three different species. The dataset includes the following features:

**Sepal length, 
Sepal width, 
Petal length, 
Petal width**

**Objectives**


Data Exploration: Visualize the dataset using different plots to understand its characteristics.
Model Building: Implement and evaluate Linear and Logistic Regression models to classify iris species.
Visualization: Use various plots to analyze model performance and data distribution.
Requirements


**Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:**

Pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

**Generates and displays various plots:**
Box Plots: To visualize feature distributions.
Heatmaps: To show correlations between features.
Displots: To illustrate the distribution of features.
Pair Plots: To explore relationships between pairs of features.
